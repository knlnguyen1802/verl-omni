# rollouts (its own consumer rides the sglang custom weight loader / the vLLM
# weight-transfer engine of newer pins), and at this pin verl's vLLM
# ServerAdapter only streams the named_tensors bucketed wire (the delta_flush
# dispatch arrives with verl#7227). verl-omni therefore registers a thin
# subclass of verl's DeltaShardedCheckpointEngine under its own backend name:
# the subclass re-declares the wire as named_tensors and flattens the flush
# stream into sentinel-named pairs, so verl's unmodified worker AND verl's
# unmodified vLLM ServerAdapter drive the whole sync -- no worker subclass, no
# gate widening, no adapter subclass. Importing this module performs the
